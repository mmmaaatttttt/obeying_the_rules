    <h4>Takeaways:</h4>  
    <p>From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/03/upshot/a-quick-puzzle-to-test-your-problem-solving.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>:</p>
    <div class="well">
      <p>
        ... most people start off with the incorrect assumption that if we're asking them to solve a problem, it must be a somewhat tricky problem. They come up with a theory for what the answer is, like: <em>Each number is double the previous number</em>. And then they make a classic psychological mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        They don’t want to hear the answer "no." In fact, it may not occur to them to ask a question that may yield a no.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remarkably, 77 percent of people who have played this game so far have guessed the answer without first hearing a single no. A mere 9 percent heard at least three nos — even though there is no penalty or cost for being told no, save the small disappointment that every human being feels when hearing "no."
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a lot more pleasant to hear "yes." That, in a nutshell, is why so many people struggle with this problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        ...Often, people never even think about asking questions that would produce a negative answer when trying to solve a problem — like this one. They instead restrict the universe of possible questions to those that might potentially yield a "yes."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>In other words, failure is sometime a <em>necessary</em> step to get to a good end result! If you haven't explored the boundaries of what doesn’t work, you may not be seeing the whole picture.</p>
